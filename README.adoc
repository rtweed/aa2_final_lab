=== AAP2 Final Lab

=== Overview

A series of reusable roles to:

* Upgrade existing monolithic playbooks to multi tier deployment playbooks
* Migrate playbooks from RHEL 7.x to RHEL 8.3.
* Switch pgsql10 to pgsql12

=== Parent Repository information

==== Quick Start

Assumes a configuration matching an AgnosticD `three-tier-app` with a `devops` service account.

. Deploy

+
[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook main.yml
----


=== Overall Architecture 

image::.images/ntier-app-topology.png[role="thumb center" width=80%]

*Concept change from `bad-ansible`*

n-tier app is designed to be well written *but* monolithic in its construction
to all useful exercises in refactoring, introducing modularity, and a backdrop
to create roles and or collections from sound a sound ansible code base.

=== Outline of main flow

* common
** setup yum repos (via satellite)
** setup firewalld
* setup postgres
** firewalld rule opening 5432
** install postgres 10
** no data load phase - come back to that?
* setup app tier
** firewalld rule opening 443

=== Development Environment

While intended to be deployed on a _real_ cloud or virtualization platform it
comes with a Vagrantfile and associated playbooks

==== Deploying the Database Tier


=== Notes:

Does firewalld need to be configured?
